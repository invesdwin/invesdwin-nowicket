					<h2>2) Wicket Integration</h2>
				</legend>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					This chapter explains how the previously explained concept is
					applied to Wicket. It expects the reader to be familiar with <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/wicket/guide/8.x/guide/single.html">Wicket
						core concepts</a> and shows how they are extended and improved by this
					framework.
				</p>
				<h3>2.1) How does it influence the daily routine?</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">For starters, let us answer this
					important question. The following activity diagram shows how you go
					around to get your work done:</p>

				<hr>
				<h4 style="text-align: center">NoWicket Development Workflow</h4>
				<img style="border: solid 1px; background: white"
					alt="NoWicket Development Workflow"
					wicket:id="developmentWorkflowImg" width="100%" />
				<hr>
				<p style="font-size: medium">You might remember reading
					something similar to this in the introduction page, where we
					highlighted the benefits of the framework in your daily live. So
					instead of repeating ourselves, we will just extend that
					information and show how you go about it from a practical
					perspective.</p>
				<ol style="font-weight: bold">
					<li><h5>
							<b>Implement Intelligent Model</b>
						</h5>
						<div style="font-weight: normal">
							After you have defined what your view should look like and what
							behavior it is supposed to have, translate that concept into one
							or more <b>model classes</b> that represent your ideas. The
							following tools are available here:
							<ul>
								<li>Use property and action methods to define your user
									interactions. Everything public will be picked up by the
									generator, though you can use the <b>@Hidden</b> annotation to
									hide even public things. Missing setters for properties or null
									values will automatically result in disabled view components.
								</li>
								<li>The <b>GuiService</b> class allows you to display
									messages, show modals, do extended internationalization and do
									page redirects from anywhere without making your model code
									aware of any Wicket specific details.
								</li>
								<li>Add <a target="_blank"
									href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/"><b>BeanValidation</b>
										(JSR-303 and JSR-349)</a> annotations to your property elements to
									keep your models clean from invalid user inputs. For more
									complex scenarios, write custom validators that intercept new
									values coming in from the UI and validate against other
									existing values from your model.
								</li>
								<li>Add <b>utility elements</b> for dynamic hide, disable,
									tooltip and titles to enhance your view logic. You can also
									access the Wicket RequestCycle, WebApplication and WebSession
									from anywhere. The <b>Roles</b> class allows you to check user
									permissions from anywhere.
								</li>
								<li>Throw <b>checked exceptions</b> with messages from your
									action elements to show the user default error dialogs. You can
									also secure actions via the <b>@PreAuthorize</b> annotation to
									allow them only for specific user roles and show also an error
									dialog on violation.
								</li>
								<li>Return other models from your action elements to cause
									a redirect there, or return null to prevent that.</li>
								<li>The default interaction scenario on the web is lazy
									form submission in order to save bandwidth and server load. To
									change this and make better use of <a target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29"><b>AJAX</b></a>,
									you can add the <b>@Eager</b> annotation where desired to give
									the user immediate feedback after he changes properties. The
									framework will automatically register onchange listeners for
									you and handle the page submit.
								</li>
								<li>It is useful to extend <b>AValueObject</b> in your
									models, since it offers a <b>DirtyTracker</b> with which it is
									easy to check for model changes and warn the user about data
									loss when redirecting without saving.
								</li>
								<li>Implement <b>hashCode</b> and <b>equals</b> methods for
									your model to control when the framework should reuse page
									instances after redirects or direct browser access.
								</li>
								<li>You can also write <b>headless unit tests</b> on those
									models using a mocked GuiService and the WicketTester (only for
									providing the Wicket context, not for actual rendering) to
									validate your model behavior.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div></li>
					<br>
					<li><h5>
							<b>Implement Wicket Page/Panel Class with GeneratedBinding
								Call</b>
						</h5>
						<div style="font-weight: normal">
							For each of your model classes, create a corresponding Wicket
							page or panel class that calls the <b>GeneratedBinding</b> inside
							its constructor. This will process the HTML file using the <a
								target="_blank"
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor
								Pattern</a>, find all Wicket IDs, match them against the model
							elements and instantiate components for them while creating a
							dynamic component tree according to the markup hierarchy. Despite
							this automated binding, you normally don't have to much more on
							the Wicket side of things. But if you need to afterall, you can
							extend this by the following means:
							<ul>
								<li>Register a <b>BindingInterceptor</b> with which you can
									substitute default components by specific Wicket IDs. When you
									have added more Wicket IDs to the HTML than represented in the
									model class, you can bind them using this mechamism too.
									Otherwise Wicket would complain about missing components at
									runtime. All component classes follow the convention used by
									Wicket to be <a target="_blank"
									href="https://programmingideaswithjake.wordpress.com/2014/12/06/designing-classes-for-extension/"><b>designed
											for extension</b></a> and thus allow you to change everything about
									them.
								</li>
								<li>You can even register default BindingInterceptors for
									your whole web application in the <b>GeneratedBindingDefaults</b>
									class. There you can also change the error handling for action
									elements which normally shows a message box on checked
									exceptions.
								</li>
								<li>Make use of the various <b>registries</b> for HTML
									components, model elements and so on to get your metadata and
									generic binding for the model, or just use the model object
									directly and hard code the binding. You can access the dynamic
									model state (enabled, hidden, tooltips, titles) from the
									elements those registries contain and call getters/setter in a
									nullsafe fashion.
								</li>
								<li>Do anything you are used to from <b>Wicket</b>, like
									inheriting from a base page, handling page parameters, doing
									crazy component hierarchy manipulation, adding behaviors,
									dynamically modify HTML tags or CSS classes.
								</li>
								<li>Use <b>I18nModel</b> to reference internationalization
									properties dynamically, or do the normal Wicket
									internationalization things.
								</li>
								<li>Use the <a target="_blank"
									href="https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/wiki/Annotation"><b>@MountPath</b></a>
									annotation to beautify the bookmarked URL or use <b>@AuthorizeInstantiation</b>
									to secure the page for specific user roles.
								</li>
								<li>Register new pages in your website navigation menu
									inside the base page your created, which should extend <b>AWebPage</b>.
									You can also change the page format from container to <b>container-fluid</b>
									there, add tracking code to your pages, provide a locale
									switcher, modify the themes or change the ajax busy indicator (<b>AjaxIndicatorAppender</b>)
									instance used.
								</li>
								<li>Change page processing settings in the web application
									using a <b>WebApplicationInitializer</b> override in your
									IWebApplicationConfig. You can also customize the session, the
									favicon, home page, authentication manager, error pages and
									sign in/sign out pages in the config class. Override the <b>BootstrapExtensionsHeaderContributor</b>
									to remove features like autofocus, enter keyboard binding,
									allowing copy/paste on disabled inputs, disabling components
									during ajax calls and retrying ajax calls on connection loss
									with <a target="_blank"
									href="http://github.hubspot.com/offline/docs/welcome/"><b>Offline.js</b></a>
									(useful for mobile connections).
								</li>
								<li>We separated the <b>IWebApplicationConfig</b> from the
									WebApplication itself to allow reuse of web.xml configurations,
									which need to have a fixed path to your WebApplication class.
									This eases configuration in a multi module project structure
									and allows you to replace the config class dynamically using a
									dependency injection context if desired.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div></li>
					<br>
					<li><h5>
							<b>Run NoWicket Generator</b>
						</h5>
						<div style="font-weight: normal">
							Run the main or test class you have setup for the generator. It
							processes your model classes using the <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern"><b>Visitor
									Pattern</b></a> and generates the HTML and properties files for them.
							If those files already exist, the generator will merge new things
							into those files at the end without touching the things you
							edited. The generator will never remove things from the output
							files, if you refactor your model, you might have to refactor
							your HTML Wicket IDs as well or remove old things to regenerate
							them. You can use the following variations of the generator:
							<ul>
								<li><b>SpecifiedGeneratedMarkup:</b> Use this class to
									define manually what model classes to process from where and
									provide the destination folder for the generated files.</li>
								<li><b>SpecifiedGeneratedMarkupMain:</b> A command line
									wrapper around the SpecifiedGeneratedMarkup so you can
									integrate it with your build tools.</li>
								<li><b>AAnnotatedGeneratedMarkup:</b> Extend this one for
									the most convenient way to generate markup. The generator will
									scan your given base packages and process all model classes
									annotated with <b>@GeneratedMarkup</b>. This generator will
									delegate the work to SpecifiedGeneratedMarkup after collecting
									all information.</li>

							</ul>
						</div></li>
					<br>
					<li><h5>
							<b>Modify HTML and Properties</b>
						</h5>
						<div style="font-weight: normal">
							Edit the generated files:
							<ul>
								<li>Adjust the order of components and put everything where
									it belongs in the <b>bootstrap grid layout</b>. You can also
									use WYSIWYG tools, just add a reference to the bootstrap CSS in
									the file header if desired. Or remove all bootstrap tags and go
									back to the table layout if desired.
								</li>
								<li><b>Modify tags</b> to change the components that should
									appear in the website. The GeneratedBinding will adjust itself
									automatically as needed and as logically possible.</li>
								<li>Add the <b>btn-primary</b> CSS class to the button you
									want to get a keyboard binding on the enter button.
								</li>
								<li>Put the <b>autofocus</b> attribute to an input to
									change the default autofocus behavior. Add it to a hidden input
									to disable autofocus.
								</li>
								<li>Remove unneeded tags or add your own <b>Wicket IDs</b>
									that you want to bind manually using a BindingInterceptor.
								</li>
								<li>Internationalize the markup by adding <a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WICKET/Everything+about+Wicket+internationalization"><b>wicket:message</b></a>
									tags and enhance the properties file as you need. Duplicate the
									properties file for other locales. You could also add more
									property elements to your model class for internationalization
									purposes.
								</li>
								<li>Uncomment the <b>feedback</b> tag to get one place for
									validation messages. Remove the gridcolumn tags around your
									inputs to prevent validation messages from appearing inline.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div></li>
					<br>
					<li><h5>
							<b>Start Web Server and View Page</b>
						</h5>
						<div style="font-weight: normal">
							To verify that your page renders properly and that it behaves as
							expected, there is no way around manually checking it in the
							browser. Start an <a target="_blank"
								href="http://www.hascode.com/2013/07/embedding-jetty-or-tomcat-in-your-java-application/">embedded
								web server</a> with Jetty or Tomcat, integrate them via their <a
								href="http://geowarin.github.io/basic-configuration-for-jetty-and-tomcat-maven-plugins.html">maven
								plugins</a> or deploy your application to a test server.
							<ul>
								<li>You could also use <a target="_blank"
									href="https://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/"><b>JRebel</b></a>
									or at least use the <a target="_blank"
									href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_hot_code_replace%3F"><b>hot
											code replacement</b></a> in the debug mode of your IDE to reduce the
									amount of restarts you need while working on the web
									application. Also use the <b>development config</b> of Wicket
									to reduce the amount of caching done. If the page cache hinders
									you, reset your session cookie to get a new session without
									restarting the application. This can be done either by deleting
									cookies in your browser, or by signing out and signing in again
									in the application.
								</li>
								<li>With a Wicket <b>deployment config</b> the website will
									automatically minify the HTML, CSS and JavaScript resources and
									do lots of other performance optimizations.
								</li>
								<li>The application also handles web crawlers <a

									prevent redirect confusion in them.

							</ul>
						</div></li>
					<br>
					<li><h5>
							<b>Page Looks and Works as Desired?</b>
						</h5>
						<div style="font-weight: normal">
							Now it is time to try out the website and get a feel for it.
							<ul>
								<li>Do your <b>usability checks</b>. Verify that buttons,
									modals, validations, behaviors, AJAX and status messages work
									as expected. Check if you are missing some of the requirements
									or did not implement them correctly.
								</li>
								<li>Test different browsers to see that bootstrap and <a
									target="_blank" href="https://modernizr.com/"><b>modernizr</b></a>
									do a good job at abstracting away inconsistencies. Verify that
									the layout is responsive on smaller screens.
								</li>
								<li>Try to <b>disable JavaScript</b> in your browser to see
									if the common Wicket ajax fallback functionality works. Where
									possible, the framework automatically binds AJAX components
									that have fallbacks, though not everything works this way.
									Things that won't work are CSS based icons, dropdown buttons
									and modals since they are dependant on JavaScript. But things
									like button clicks and basic navigation will still work, which
									should be enough for most bots to index your website properly.
								</li>
								<li>If you find something odd, just go back a few steps to
									<b>modify/extend/refine</b> the appropriate files, rerun the
									generator if needed and check again. Sometimes this is just a
									matter of <a target="_blank"

				<h3>2.2) Does it change Wickets internal processing?</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">Not at all! Wicket still behaves as
					usual and all artifacts you are used to are still present in your
					project. Wickets internal processing is demonstrated by the
					following graphic:</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 style="text-align: center">Wickets Internal Processing</h4>
				<img
					style="border: solid 1px; background: white; text-align: center; margin-left: 17.5%"
					alt="Wickets Internal Processing"
					wicket:id="wicketsInternalProcessingImg" width="65%" />
				<hr>
				<p style="font-size: medium">We will explain next at which steps
					the NoWicket framework is active during Wickets internal
					processing:</p>
				<ol style="font-weight: bold">
					<li>Request:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">As usual the web browser
							asks the Wicket application to retrieve a page. The Wicket
							application was setup using the NoWicket AWebApplication base
							class and is thus configured according to your
							IWebApplicationConfig. If no session is present yet, it creates a
							new one for the client.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Lookup:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">Then Wicket checks its page
							store, if it finds a page, it returns it directly. The addition
							here is that AWebApplication adds its own model aware session
							page cache on top of the page store. So if a bookmarkable URL was
							requested for which a new model was created, but that created
							model matches in equality to a model from a previous page in the
							page store, then that previous page instance is served instead of
							returning a new page. The user will still see his UI state as it
							previously was. So for example sorting information in a data
							table will be the same as previously, data paging will still be
							on the old page and validation messages will still be there. This
							transforms dump links (ones without the ?{ID} parameter) into
							page store aware links.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Locate:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">If the page store was
							empty, Wicket locates the appropriate page class to be served.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Parse:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">Then it parses the
							requested HTML template and sees what Wicket IDs need to be
							provided as components by the page class.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Instantiate:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">And instantiates the page
							class to combine both. If the page was requested from a
							bookmarkable link, then the page constructor without a model
							argument will be used, where you will be responsible to create a
							new moedl instance. Otherwise if this was an internal redirect
							based on a model, then the page will be instantiated with a model
							constructor where you will be responsible to use use it since it
							might be specially configured from the redirecting code. Remember
							from above that action elements in models and code using the
							GuiService can do model based redirects.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Bind:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">The page instance will then
							build its component hierarchy corresponding to the HTML template
							and bind values from the model into the HTML placeholders. Here
							the GeneratedBinding takes place if you put it into the
							constructor (otherwise you do it the classic Wicket way). The
							binding might add other panels into the hierarchy which also have
							their corresponding markup and initializations with a separate
							GeneratedBinding taking place. In each case separate
							BindingInterceptors and component modifications might be used.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Store:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">When everything between the
							HTML and the model is wired up, Wicket will put the new page
							instance into the page store for future lookups.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Render:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">Then it will render the
							HTML document and put in the values from the model that were
							wired.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Respond:
						<div style="font-weight: normal">And finally it answers the
							browser with the content requested.</div>
					</li>
