					and preparations from the previous chapters we are ready to finally
					dig into some code and explain how these things are controlled
					exactly.</p>

				<h3>5.1) JavaBeans</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					When working with this framework, it is important to follow the <a
						target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans">JavaBean</a>
					conventions for accessing attributes. An “attribute” is a data
					member of a Java class which – according to the JavaBean convention
					- is accessed by appropriate getter and setter methods. It is best
					practice that the identifier following the “get”- and “set”-prefix
					corresponds to the name of the attribute, whereby the first letter
					is capitalized.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: medium">An attribute</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">
private String name;</pre>
				<p style="font-size: medium">is accessed from outside the class
					by the member functions</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">
public String getName();
public void setName(String name);</pre>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The notation with the leading
					capital letter is often referred to as a property of the class. A
					class may very well contain virtual properties, i.e. properties
					that do not refer to an attribute of the corresponding name but
					e.g. to an assembly or type conversion of other attributes. The
					actual names of attributes are therefore a secondary aspect. Many
					frameworks that are based on Java reflection, work with the
					JavaBean convention and assume its correct usage by the developers.
					This is also true for invesdwin-NoWicket. So if this documentation
					uses the term “property”, it refers to the convention above. The
					term “component” refers to components on the screen, i.e. a text
					field, a check box, a combo box etc.</p>
