						A <a target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked
							objects</a> framework for wicket that enables developers to write
						less boilerplate wicket code during implementation of complex
						websites. Without sacrificing the flexibility and control you are
						used from wicket. Improving productivity by a measurable factor
						and making wicket more fun.

				<p style="font-size: medium">This project is built on top of
					other amazing open source frameworks:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://wicket.apache.org/">wicket</a>
						for its ability to reuse components while maintaining flexbility
						and control</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">twitter-bootstrap</a>
						for its superb layouting capabilities and responsive grid layout</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://wb.agilecoders.de/">wicket-bootstrap</a>
						for its amazing twitter-bootstrap integration for components and
						other goodies</li>
					<li><a target="_blank"
						href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/">spring-security</a>
						for its allmighty security capabilities and easy configurability
						(not relying on a spring-context)</li>
					<li><a target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-norva">invesdwin-norva</a>
						for a unified and naked objects aware reflection and visitor API</li>
					<li>Optional: <a target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/thombergs/wicked-charts">wicked-charts</a>
						for its easy to use <a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.highcharts.com/">highcharts</a> integration,
						including extensions for <a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock">highstock</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					In comparison to other naked objects frameworks like <a
						target="_blank" href="https://isis.apache.org/">Apache Isis</a>,
					this is not a full blown <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
					framework:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It aims at being a lightweight web framework instead of
						being a development platform. You still use your tools of choice
						for dependency injection, container management, application
						integration, persistence management, etc.</li>
					<li>It does not abstract away wicket or the html used with it,
						but instead embraces it by doing the routine work for you,
						allowing you to fully customize it to your layout and design
						requirements. It allows you to do this directly in the html
						instead of forcing you to use css for everything or some sort of
						domain specific language or abstract API.</li>
					<li>Same goes for the binding, instead of doing all the work
						behind layers of walls, you can tap into any part of the binding
						and provide your own components particularly where needed, as
						needed.</li>
					<li>It always allows you to do anything you are able to do
						with wicket. Following the <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto
							principle</a>, this enables you to take control over those 20%
						complex requirements while not having to waste time implementing
						the standard 80% of requirements.
					</li>
					<li>It is also suitable for rapid prototyping of web
						applications while not requiring you to throw away the prototype,
						but instead just continuing work on it to make it a full
						application.</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<p style="font-size: medium">This framework also improves wicket
					development in a few other spots:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>By enforcing a clean use of the <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>
						pattern in your code (wicket still allows you to store state in
						page classes or spread it over lots of micro models), you can
						easily write automated unit tests for the logic of your models.
						They control most of the functionality of your pages, can run
						headless and can be tested easily with this framework. Only write
						those brittle <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">selenium</a>
						or <a target="_blank"
						href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/wicket/guide/7.x/guide/testing.html">wicket-tester</a>
						tests where actually needed, but not to validate your logic of the
						presentation layer. Instead do it typesafe and much more robust on
						the models themselves.
					</li>
					<li>The browser back button support of wicket is nice, but it
						does not easily remember page state when reentering a page from a
						bookmarkable link or other means of redirects in your application.
						Also you can get lost in old page states easily when navigating in
						the browser. This framework eases this by using a lightweight
						session based page cache that lets it feel more like a <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single
							page application</a> when you want it to. Just override the hashCode
						and equals methods in your models appropriate to your needs and
						NoWicket will reuse pages and models where the same logical model
						state is used (still allowing you to keep full control by deciding
						otherwise in the onPageModelRefresh hook of your page).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<p style="font-size: medium">Your typical development process
					with this framework would be (as an elaborate example):</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Divide your desired page into a set of classes using the
						naked objects pattern in your mind or design it using a class
						diagram. You can even reuse existing transfer or persistence
						classes without modifying them where appropriate (being able to
						extend them from the outside using @BeanPathRedirect).<br /> <b>=&gt;
							Your benefit: Your models reflect directly your UI both in naming
							and in structure.</b>
					</li>
					<li>Write your models appropriately and choose the model
						elements depending on the information that is to be visualized.
						Also decide for each class if it should be a page or a panel (or
						even both) by creating appropriate classes for those. Add complex
						validation, tooltips, hiding, disabling, redirects, modals and
						other presentation logic to your models.<br /> <b>=&gt; Your
							benefit: Only one place that contains the important state
							information.</b>
					</li>
					<li>Run the NoWicket html generator for your models to get
						bootstrappified markup which normally takes a long time to write
						down and do right for some components. <br /> <b>=&gt; Your
							benefit: Write less html code yourself.</b>
					</li>
					<li>Refine the generated html manually by moving things where
						you want them and visualize regularly in the browser to make
						adjustments. You could also use a <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor
						here. You can make full use of the bootstrap grid layout or remove
						all of the tags and write your own classic table layout. <br /> <b>=&gt;
							Your benefit: A lot less refactorings in wicket code, since the
							generated binding handles wickets binding hierarchy
							automatically.</b>
					</li>
					<li>Modify the generated properties files to name the
						components as you want them, add some button icons or
						internationalization to your pages. Note that all strings returned
						from the model are internationalizable since you can also just
						return keys for the properties files as desired. <br /> <b>=&gt;
							Your benefit: No need to lookup wicket ids since they get
							generated with texts from your models. Only change texts as
							needed.</b>
					</li>
					<li>If you are missing some components, just add them to the
						model and run the html generator again. It will merge the new
						markup snippets into your existing html files without destroying
						your manual changes in them. After they are in there, just move
						them as well to where you want them. If you want to undo some of
						your changes, just delete the desired tags to let them get
						generated again. The generator always checks for the wicket ids
						before generating anything. <br /> <b>=&gt; Your benefit: No
							need to redo everything, instead merge changes.</b>
					</li>
					<li>If you are unhappy with some components, just change the
						tags to transform them. For example:
						<ul>
							<li>convert a text input into a password input or a text
								area</li>
							<li>convert a select box into a radio input or set a size to
								make it into a list</li>
							<li>change a button into a link</li>
							<li>convert a table into a ul for a ListView of panels</li>
							<li>make a file upload input handle multiple files</li>
						</ul> The framework aims to be flexible and intuitive with this. If the
						automated binding does not support your desired changes, just
						enhance the binding manually by adding a BindingInterceptor for
						your special cases. Do the same for any components that are not
						represented in your models and are thus unknown to the generated
						binding. <br /> <b>=&gt; Your benefit: Only write binding
							code for the components you have to.</b>
					</li>
					<li>Add complex features into your page or panels, utilizing
						the element and component registry in the NoWicket HtmlContext.
						This gives you access to the wicket components and <a
						target="_blank" href="https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-norva">invesdwin-norva</a>
						reflection elements that got generated. Or access the page model
						directly to do some extended manual binding. For example handling
						page parameters or the page lifecycle.<br /> <b>=&gt; Your
							benefit: Full access to everything.</b>
					</li>
					<li>Last but not least, write some headless unit tests on your
						models logic as desired.<br /> <b>=&gt; Your benefit: Stay
							maintainable for future refactorings and have something to alert
							on regressions.</b>
					</li>
				</ol>
