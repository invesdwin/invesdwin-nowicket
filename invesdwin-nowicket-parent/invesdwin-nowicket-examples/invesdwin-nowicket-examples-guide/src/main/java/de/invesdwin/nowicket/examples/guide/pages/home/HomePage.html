				<p>
					A <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked
						objects</a> framework for wicket that enables developers to write less
					boilerplate wicket code during implementation of complex websites.
					Without sacrificing the flexibility and control you are used from
					wicket. Improving productivity by a measurable factor and making
					wicket more fun.

				<p style="font-size: medium">This project is built on top of
					other amazing open source frameworks:
				<ul>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://wicket.apache.org/">wicket</a>
						for its ability to reuse components while maintaining flexbility
						and control</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">twitter-bootstrap</a>
						for its superb layouting capabilities and responsive grid layout</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://wb.agilecoders.de/">wicket-bootstrap</a>
						for its amazing twitter-bootstrap integration for components and
						other goodies</li>
					<li><a target="_blank"
						href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/">spring-security</a>
						for its allmighty security capabilities and easy configurability
						(not relying on a spring-context)</li>
					<li>Optional: <a target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/thombergs/wicked-charts">wicked-charts</a>
						for its easy to use <a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.highcharts.com/">highcharts</a> integration,
						including extensions for <a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock">highstock</a></li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					In comparison to other naked objects frameworks like <a
						target="_blank" href="https://isis.apache.org/">Apache Isis</a>,
					this is not a full blown <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
					framework:
				<ul>
					<li>It aims at being a lightweight web framework instead of
						being a development platform. You still use your tools of choice
						for dependency injection, container management, application
						integration, persistence management, et al.</li>
					<li>It does not abstract away wicket or the html used with it,
						but instead embraces it by doing the routine work for you,
						allowing you to fully customize it to your layout and design
						requirements. Directly in the html instead of forcing you to use
						css for everything or some sort of domain specific language or
						abstract API.</li>
					<li>Same goes for the binding, instead of doing all the work
						behind layers of walls, you can tap into any part of the binding
						and provide your own components particularly where needed, as
						needed.</li>
					<li>It always allows you to do anything you are able to do
						with wicket. This enables you to take control over those 20%
						complex requirements while not having to waste time implementing
						the standard 80% of requirements.</li>
					<li>It is also suitable for rapid prototyping of web
						applications while not requiring you to throw away the prototype,
						but instead just continuing work on it to make it a full
						application.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>


				<p style="font-size: medium">This framework also improves wicket
					development in a few other spots:
				<ul>
					<li>By enforcing a clean use of the <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>
						pattern in your code (wicket still allows you to store state in
						page classes or spread it over lots of micro models), you can
						easily write automated unit tests for the logic of your models.
						They control most of the functionality of your pages, can run
						headless and can be tested easily with this framework. Only write
						those brittle <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">selenium</a>
						or <a target="_blank"
						href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/wicket/guide/7.x/guide/testing.html">wicket-tester</a>
						tests where actually needed, but not to validate your business
						logic of the presentation layer. Instead do it typesafe and much
						more robust on the models themselves.
					</li>
					<li>The browser back button support of wicket is nice, but it
						does not easily remember page state when reentering a page from a
						bookmarkable link or other means of redirects in your application,
						also you can get lost in old page states easily when navigating in
						the browser. This framework eases this by using a lightweight
						session based page cache that lets it feel more like a <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single
							page application</a> when you want it to. Just override the hashCode
						and equals methods in your models appropriate to your needs and
						NoWicket will reuse pages and models where the same logical model
						state is used (still allowing you to keep full control by deciding
						otherwise in the onPageModelRefresh hook of your page).
					</li>
				</ul>
