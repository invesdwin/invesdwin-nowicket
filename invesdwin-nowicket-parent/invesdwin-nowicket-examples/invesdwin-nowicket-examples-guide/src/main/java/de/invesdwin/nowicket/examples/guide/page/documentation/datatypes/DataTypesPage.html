				<p style="font-size: medium">This chapter describes the default
					visualizations for domain objects.</p>

				<h3>6.1) Simple Data Types</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The following basic data types are
					supported by this framework and are visualized as follows:</p>

				<div style="border: solid 1px; background: white"
					wicket:id="simpleDataTypesPanel"></div>
				<br>

				<p style="font-size: medium">Click the date sample to show the
					date picker. Try changing some values to see the default
					validations in action (leave focus to apply change):</p>

				<ul>
					<li>primitive types are not null validated</li>
					<li>numbers and chars are validated by range limits</li>
					<li>fractional digits are only allowed on appropriate number
						types</li>
					<li>dates have to be in correct format</li>
					<li>enum literals are validated against value manipulation
						(e.g. with <a target="_blank" href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>)
					</li>
					<li><a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.mvvm.ro/2011/03/sanitize-strings-against-sql-injection.html">rudimentary
							sql injection validation</a> is performed on string values (try
						";drop table users"); though don't mistake it for <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement">real
							security</a>, it only works against <a target="_blank"
						href="https://www.noisebridge.net/images/9/96/ScriptKITTY.jpg">script
							kitties</a>, thus this feature can be disabled in the
						GeneratedBinding if desired</li>
				</ul>

				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Currently there is no out of the box support for <a target="_blank"
						href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html">java.time</a>,
					<a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">joda-time</a> or any other
					custom type library for dates or numbers. This is because there is
					a simple workaround, just convert between the types in your
					getters/setters if you want a field of an unsupported type. You can
					still externalize the original type via @Hidden methods for your
					internal coding needs. Just make sure to convert to a supported
					type for the framework or completely handle the binding yourself
					with a BindingInterceptor and custom components.
				</p>

				<p style="font-size: medium">By default the framework displays
					all properties of a class which have a public getter method
					defined. If there is also a public setter method defined, the
					displayed field is editable, otherwise it is read-only. You could
					also provide public fields (which is the same as a getter and a
					setter combined), even though this is rather unusual when following
					the JavaBeans pattern.</p>

				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Every field is preceded by a label with a text that is derived from
					the property name. <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a>
					syntax causes a whitespace splitting (e.g.
					<code>getNumberOfChildren()</code>
					is displayed as "Number Of Children"). These labels were explicitly
					removed from the above samples.
				</p>

				<h3>6.2) Collections & Arrays</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					If the property is a collection/array of a simple data type, it is
					always mapped to a
					<code>select</code>
					tag. This will show it as a combo box. You can set a
					<code>size</code>
					attribute to convert it to a list as done below (the lists are
					disabled because the properties do not have a setter). But what we
					are going for here are tables, not lists or combo boxes.
				</p>

				<p style="font-size: medium">
					So to do it correct, you have to use the proper types. Arrays and
					collections for complex data types are by default mapped to tables.
					The table contains one row for each element of the
					collection/array. To achieve a detailed visualization of domain
					objects from a collection, the collection should be typed using
					Java generics. Otherwise the framework can only display "the least
					common denominator" which is <code>toString()</code> for all contained objects.
					The table displays only the data of the contained type. As a
					consequence, if the collection also contains objects of derived
					types, the additional properties of these types are not displayed
					(e.g. a collection of vehicles contains cars and bikes with
					additional properties, but the generic type is of car. Thus the
					table displays only the properties of the vehicle base class). Also
					note that tables only allow shallow columns to be displayed,
					everything else is displayed as <code>toString()</code>. You see this below in
					the
					<code>nested</code>
					column that contains
					<code>column3</code>
					in a structured type.
				</p>

				<div
					style="border: solid 1px; background: white; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px"
					wicket:id="tablesPanel"></div>
				<br>


				<p style="font-size: medium">
					If you want to see a more realistic table example, please open the
					<a target="_blank" href="ajaxdatatable">Ajax Data Table</a> example
					from the Wicket Examples Rebuilt item in the top menu.
				</p>

				<h3>6.3) Structured Data Types</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">Domain objects may be structured by
					one class referencing another class. The related objects are in
					this case displayed within the UI of the referencing object. To
					separate the fields from each other, the fields for referenced
					objects are displayed under a separation line with the name of the
					reference as a caption.</p>

				<p style="font-size: medium">The following example shows a more
					comprehensive model for a car. The motor with its methods for
					turning it off and on are implemented in a separate class. There is
					a number of additional attributes with different data types now.
					All trips which have been made with that car are associated by an
					array.</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">public class Car implements Serializable {
				
	private String licenseNumber;
	private CarBrand brand;
	private long kmMileage;
	private BigDecimal purchasePrice;
	private boolean technicalControl;
	private Date registrationDate;
	private Trip[] tripBook;
	private Motor motor;

	// constructor, getters/setters omitted here
	
}

public class Motor implements Serializable {

	private int powerInHP;
	private MotorState state;
	
	// constructor, getters/setters omitted here

	public void turnOn() { this.state = MotorState.on; }
	public void turnOff() { this.state = MotorState.off; }
	
}

public class Trip implements Serializable {

	private String from;
	private String to;
	private int distanceInKM;
	
	// constructor, getters/setters omitted here
	
}</pre>

				<p style="font-size: medium">This results in the following
					panel:</p>

				<div
					style="border: solid 1px; background: white; padding-top: 15px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px"
					wicket:id="thirdCarPanel"></div>
				<br>

				<p style="font-size: medium">This looks better than the previous
					examples, but it allows logically incorrect input values. To fix
					this, the next chapter explains how to add validations.</p>
