				<h3>6.1) Simple Data Types</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The following basic data types are
					supported by this framework and are visualized as follows:</p>

				<div style="border: solid 1px; background: white; font-size: medium"
					wicket:id="simpleDataTypesPanel"></div>
				<br>

				<p style="font-size: medium">Click the date sample to show the
					date picker. Try changing some values to see the default
					validations in action (leave focus to apply change):</p>

				<ul>
					<li>primitive types are not null validated</li>
					<li>numbers and chars are validated by range limits</li>
					<li>fractional digits are only allowed on appropriate number
						types</li>
					<li>dates have to be in correct format</li>
					<li>enum literals are validated against value manipulation
						(e.g. with <a target="_blank" href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>)
					</li>
					<li><a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.mvvm.ro/2011/03/sanitize-strings-against-sql-injection.html">rudimentary
							sql injection validation</a> is performed on string values (try
						";drop table users")<br>(though don't mistake it for real
						security, it only works against <a target="_blank"
						href="https://www.noisebridge.net/images/9/96/ScriptKITTY.jpg">script
							kitties</a>)</li>
				</ul>

				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Currently there is no out of the box support for <a target="_blank"
						href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html">java.time</a>,
					<a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">joda-time</a> or any other
					custom type library for dates or numbers. This is due to keeping
					dependencies minimal on the framework. Also there is a simple
					workaround, just convert between the types in your getters/setters
					if you want a field of an unsupported type. You can still
					externalize the original type via @Hidden methods for your internal
					coding needs. Just make sure to convert to a supported type for the
					framework or handle the binding yourself with a BindingInterceptor
					and custom components.
				</p>

				<p style="font-size: medium">If there is a limited value set
					specified for a property of these data types (see following
					sections about choice methods), it is always mapped to a combo box
					independently of the actual data type.</p>

				<p style="font-size: medium">By default the framework displays
					all properties of a class which have a public getter method
					defined. If there is also a public setter method defined, the
					displayed field is editable, otherwise it is read-only. You could
					also provide public fields (which is the same as a getter and a
					setter combined), even though this is rather unusual when following
					the JavaBeans pattern.</p>

				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Every field is preceded by a label with a text that is derived from
					the property name. <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a>
					syntax causes a whitespace splitting (e.g. getNumberOfChildren() is
					displayed as "Number Of Children"). These labels were explicitly
					removed from the above samples.
