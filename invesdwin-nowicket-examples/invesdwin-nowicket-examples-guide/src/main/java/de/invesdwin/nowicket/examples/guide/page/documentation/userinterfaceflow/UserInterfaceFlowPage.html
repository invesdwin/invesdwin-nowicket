					<h2>8) User Interface Flow</h2>
				</legend>
				<p style="font-size: medium">Implementing User Interface Flow
					(UI Flow) and dialog navigation is very simple: every result from a
					method call is displayed as a new page. The browser will be
					automatically redirected to the appropriate page for the model that
					was returned:</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">public &lt;ModelOfPage&gt; someAction() { return new &lt;ModelOfPage&gt;(); }</pre>

				<p style="font-size: medium">As an alternative, there is an API
					function available for that:</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">GuiService.get().showPage(new &lt;ModelOfPage&gt;());</pre>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The GuiService can be called from
					anywhere you want. It stores the actions you put into it and
					performs them after your method returned, before the response is
					rendered.</p>

				<h3>8.1) Modal Dialogs</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Modal dialogs can be displayed in two different ways. The API-free
					and therefore more test-friendly and portable way is to annotate a
					method with
					<code>@ModalOpener</code>
					which causes the methods return value not to be displayed as a new
					page (as above) but as a modal dialog inside the initiating page:
				</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">@ModalOpener public &lt;ModelOfPanel&gt; someAction() { return new &lt;ModelOfPanel&gt;(); }</pre>

				<p style="font-size: medium">Same as above, you also have the
					alternative of an API function available for that:</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">GuiService.get().showModalPanel(new &lt;ModelOfPanel&gt;());</pre>

				<p style="font-size: medium">There is also another function
					available that lets you specify a size for the modal dialog. Due to
					the asynchronous nature of web applications, this method does not
					block during display of the modal dialog (as you might be used to
					from desktop UI frameworks). So we cannot return any feedback
					result from the modal with this API call. Though there is an
					elegant solution to this.</p>

				<h4>
					<u>Getting Feedback From Modals</u>
				</h4>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					As usual, every action method of the modal model class becomes a
					button in the dialog. By default, clicking one of the buttons
					behaves as normal (which might redirect to another page or open
					another modal if annotated as a modal opener). If you want the
					modal to be closed upon a button press, you have to annotate it
					with
					<code>@ModalCloser</code>
					. If the initiating domain object is supposed to be manipulated by
					the modal operation, there are two options:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The modal object must become aware of the initiator,
						usually by simply passing the initiator in the modally displayed
						objects constructor.</li>
					<li>Override some methods and hook into the modal models
						action methods to manipulate the outer model from inside an
						anonymous class that extends the modal class.</li>
				</ol>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The second approach provides a way
					to create modal classes that can be reused anywhere, since they
					themselves are not aware of their caller. Only the caller makes
					them aware in their extension inside himself.</p>

				<h4>
					<u>Message & Confirm Boxes</u>
				</h4>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Message boxes and confirm boxes require no special functionality in
					the framework. You just implement them as a generated panel model
					and do anything you want as you are used to. Though for convenience
					there is a
					<code>ModalMessage</code>
					class that can be reused for the most common dialog needs. Just
					create an anonymous class as an extension for it and customize it
					as you want in the override. The framework even allows you to
					rename the buttons (via title utility methods), hiding them (via
					hide utility methods) or prevent them from closing the modal
					despite the original class having them annotated as a modal closer
					(by removing the annotation from the overridden method). The only
					limitation is that you cannot add components, since they will not
					be picked up by the HTML generator when defined inside anonymous
					inner classes. In this case you should rather implement a new modal
					class that fits your needs. See the <a target="_blank"
						href="forminput">Form Input</a> page from the Wicket Examples
					Rebuilt item in the top menu. There you can see an example of a
					modified
					<code>ModalMessage</code>
					class that is displayed when the reset button detects model changes
					that might get lost (via dirty check). <a target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-nowicket/blob/master/invesdwin-nowicket-examples/invesdwin-nowicket-examples-guide/src/main/java/de/invesdwin/nowicket/examples/guide/page/wicket/forminput/FormInput.java">Click
						here</a> to have a look at the source code of this example, look out
					for the reset method implementation.
				</p>


				<h3>8.2) Tabbed Panes</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">A tabbed pane consists of the
					following elements:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Inside the model that should contain a tabbed pane, you
						have to define a property that is annotated with <code>@Tabbed</code>
						(either the getter, the field or the type of the field should be
						annotated).
					</li>
					<li>The tabbed pane type should consist of properties for each
						panel that should be tabbed.</li>
					<li>For each of those panel properties, you implement a model
						for a generated panel as you are used to.</li>
				</ol>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					For an example of this, have a look at the <a target="_blank"
						href="tabbedpanel">Tabbed Panel</a> page from the Wicket Examples
					Rebuilt item in the top menu. It also demonstrates how utility
					elements can be used to hide/disable tabs and how the order of the
					tabs can be specified with the @ColumnOrder annotation (which also
					works for setting the order of table columns). <a target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-nowicket/tree/master/invesdwin-nowicket-examples/invesdwin-nowicket-examples-guide/src/main/java/de/invesdwin/nowicket/examples/guide/page/wicket/tabbedpanel">Click
						here</a> for the source code of this example.
				</p>

				<h3>8.3) Wizards</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Wizards in this frameworks sense are nothing special, since they
					just define action methods for next and previous steps. You can
					implement them both as pages and as modals. You make each steps
					model aware of its previous one and next one and provide thus a UI
					flow that results in a wizard. To see an example of this, have a
					look at the <a target="_blank" href="wizard">Wizard</a> page from
					the Wicket Examples Rebuilt item in the top menu. <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-nowicket/tree/master/invesdwin-nowicket-examples/invesdwin-nowicket-examples-guide/src/main/java/de/invesdwin/nowicket/examples/guide/page/wicket/wizard">Click
						here</a> for the source code of this example. You can also go a step
					further than the example and reuse the navigation buttons of your
					step panels by putting them in a separate generated panel that you
					use via composition in your step pages/panels (adding them via a
					BindingInterceptor after manually adding them to the HTML files as
					a Wicket tag).
				</p>

				<h3>8.4) Try It</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The following class shows a query
					page which provides a set of car rows. To show the details of a car
					row, each car row object must provide an appropriate method which
					simply returns the car page model itself. This will already cause a
					UI flow.</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">public class CarSearch implements Serializable {
				
	private ArrayList&lt;CarSearchRow&gt; cars;

	public CarSearch() {
	    cars = new ArrayList&lt;CarSearchRow&gt;();
	    cars.add(new CarSearchRow(new CarDetails(this, "LunarIndustries", "XY-ZA 123")));
	    // keep filling up the list of cars
	}
	
	public ArrayList&lt;CarSearchRow&gt; getCars() { return cars; }
	
}

public class CarSearchRow implements Serializable {

    private final CarDetails details;

    public CarSearchRow(final CarDetails details) {
        this.details = details;
    }

    public CarDetails details() { return details; }

    // uninteresting getters omitted

    public String getTrips() {
        return details.getTabs().getTripInfo().getTripBook().size() + " ("
                + details.getTabs().getTripInfo().getDistanceInKMSum() + " KM)";
    }

}</pre>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The above is generated as a page
					for an overview of all cars. It displays them in a table and
					provides a page redirect in the "details" action column. The car
					details page model is defined as a tabbed pane and provides a
					button to navigate back.</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">public class CarDetails implements Serializable {

    private final CarSearch parent;
    private final CarTabs tabs;

    public CarDetails(final CarSearch parent, final String brand, final String licenseNumber) {

				<p style="font-size: medium">The tab panel models themselves

				<p style="font-size: medium">While the new trip modal class just
					defines its modal closer action methods and adds some validation
					for the inputs.</p>

}
</pre>

				<p style="font-size: medium">This time we embedded the sample as
					an iframe instead of as a panel like the previous ones. So the
					navigation is triggering actual page redirects without having to
					leave this chapter. It also shows how you can implement pages
					without having a navigation bar. Also it is to be noted that the
					navigation remembers previous page state (like the previously
					selected tab for a car details page) and synchronizes new
					information back to the car search page (like a new trip or changed
					car info). This works in this example without any persistence layer
					due to the magic of the NoWicket page model session cache. You can
					try it below.</p>

				<iframe src="fifthcarsearch"
					style="border: solid 1px; width: 100%; height: 500px"></iframe>

				<p style="font-size: medium">As a gimmick we also demonstrate a
					validation on the trip book table. Wicket normally does not support
					this easily, but NoWicket does it out of the box for you. When
					trying to leave the trip info tab of a car details page, it will
					not let you leave the panel until you have added a trip.</p>
