					<h2>5) Tutorial Start</h2>
				</legend>
				<p style="font-size: medium">Now after all the theoretical stuff
					and preparations from the previous chapters we are ready to finally
					dig into some code and explain how these things are controlled
					exactly.</p>

				<h3>5.1) JavaBeans</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					When working with this framework, it is important to follow the <a
						target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans">JavaBean</a>
					conventions for accessing attributes. An "attribute" is a data
					member of a Java class which - according to the JavaBean convention
					- is accessed by appropriate getter and setter methods. It is best
					practice that the identifier following the "get"- and "set"-prefix
					corresponds to the name of the attribute, whereby the first letter
					is capitalized.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: medium">An attribute:</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">
private String name;</pre>
				<p style="font-size: medium">is accessed from outside the class:
					by the member functions</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">
public String getName();
public void setName(String name);</pre>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The notation with the leading
					capital letter is often referred to as a property of the class. A
					class may very well contain virtual properties, i.e. properties
					that do not refer to an attribute of the corresponding name but
					e.g. to an assembly or type conversion of other attributes. The
					actual names of attributes are therefore a secondary aspect. Many
					frameworks that are based on Java reflection, work with the
					JavaBean convention and assume its correct usage by the developers.
					This is also true for invesdwin-NoWicket. So if this documentation
					uses the term "property", it refers to the convention above. The
					term "component" refers to components on the screen, i.e. a text
					field, a check box, a combo box etc.</p>

				<h3>5.2) The First Generated UI</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">To display a first generic user
					interface, we simply need a pure Java bean (a "POJO" if you like
					that term).</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">public class Car implements Serializable {
	
	private String state;
	private String licenseNumber;
	private String brand;

	public Car() {
		this.state = "off";
	}

	public String getLicenseNumber() { return licenseNumber; }
	public String getBrand() { return brand; }
	public String getState() { return state; }

	public void setLicenseNumber(String licenseNumber) { this.licenseNumber = licenseNumber; }
	public void setBrand(String brand) { this.brand = brand; }
	public void setState(String state) { this.state = state; }
	
}</pre>

				<p style="font-size: medium">This is what it looks like when it
					is used as a panel:</p>

				<div style="border: solid 1px; background: white; padding-top: 15px"
					wicket:id="firstCarPanel"></div>
				<br>

				<p style="font-size: medium">So the Java class was visualized in
					a straight-forward way. The HTML generator sorts the components per
					default in alphabetical order, but you can rearrange them later.
					The only GUI code required was the panel declaration (which could
					also have been a page as in the previous chapter):</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">public class CarPanel extends Panel {

    public CarPanel(final String id, final IModel&lt;Car&gt; model) {
        super(id, model);
        new GeneratedBinding(this).bind();
    }

}</pre>

				<h3>5.3) Adding Actions</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The state of the car was
					arbitrarily changeable in the last example. Now the car should
					better provide methods for reasonable state changes. The methods
					should only allow to turn the car off and on.</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-java linenums">public class Car implements Serializable {

	// attribute definitions, constructor, getters/setters omitted here
	
	public void turnOn() {
		this.state = "on";
	}
	
	public void turnOff() {
		this.state = "off";
	}
	
}</pre>

				<p style="font-size: medium">To ensure that the state is not
					modified interactively without activating the methods, we remove
					the setter method for the attribute. This results in the following
					panel:</p>

				<div style="border: solid 1px; background: white; padding-top: 15px"
					wicket:id="secondCarPanel"></div>
				<br>

				<p style="font-size: medium">The buttons were aligned manually
					after the HTML file was generated. The framework adds buttons only
					for methods without parameters. If a method throws a checked
					exception, the exception text is displayed in an error message box.
					The exception text automatically walks through localization, so you
					may as well just provide a localization key that refers to a
					translation in a Wicket property file. Throwing an exception
					without a message will silently be swallowed, assuming that the
					originating problem has already been handled in the code and does
					not need to be reported graphically. Runtime exceptions will be
					handled via the default Wicket exception handling, thus an internal
					error page will be displayed. You can change this behavior by
					setting a custom ISubmitButtonExceptionHandler in the
					GeneratedBindingDefaults class.</p>


				<h3>5.4) Next Steps</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The two sections above demonstrate
					that it is fairly simple to display a domain object. Nevertheless
					there arise various questions from the examples:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How can I avoid the activation of turnOn for an already
						running car?</li>
					<li>Is there a different way to disable fields rather than by
						removing or renaming the setter?</li>
					<li>How can I limit the brand to a particular set of
						reasonable values?</li>
					<li>Which other data types can be displayed by the framework?</li>
					<li>How can I ensure that the license number follows a
						particular format?</li>
					<li>May domain objects be nested?</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The following chapters give answers
					to these and many other questions.</p>
