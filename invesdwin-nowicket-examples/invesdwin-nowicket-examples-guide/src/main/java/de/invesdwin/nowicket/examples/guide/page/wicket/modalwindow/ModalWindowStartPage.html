			This is a rewrite of the <a target="_blank"
				href="http://examples7x.wicket.apache.org/ajax/modal-window">"show
				modal dialog with a page" example from wicket</a>. Though we do not use
			pages (which come with some limitations) but instead use panels
			(without the limitation of not supporting nested panels). The twist
			here is that we use the <a target="_blank"
				href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/62001819">same modal
				panel not only for the modal</a>, but also the page and <a
				target="_blank" href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/44945569">more
				nested modals</a>, to allow you to test out the maximum of possible
			modals your browser can handle (<a target="_blank"
				href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/62196858">as long as you
				can handle all the clicking</a>). Also note how you can easily pass
			state from a nested modal to its parent by making each aware of the
			other (this is a lot easier in the models and allows more freedom
			than wickets solution, since the modal does not actually have to know
			its parent (page) and can thus more easily be reused, though nothing
			prevents you from doing tight coupling).
