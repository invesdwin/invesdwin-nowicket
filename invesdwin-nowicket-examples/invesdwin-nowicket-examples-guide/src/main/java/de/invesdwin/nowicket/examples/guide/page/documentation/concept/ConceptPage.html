					<h2>1) Concept</h2>
				</legend>
				<p style="font-size: medium">The following text can be seen as a
					concept documentation. It explains foundational decisions, as well
					as design and architecture patterns used by the framework. It helps
					in understanding the ideas behind the framework and how it is
					supposed to work.</p>
				<h3>1.1) Domain Driven Design</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					One of the largest problems in software projects is not technology,
					but language and semantics. One might think it is easy to build
					great products with great tools, but this will ultimately fail when
					requirements are misunderstood or the code is unmaintainable over
					the long term. Just because it does not reflect the problem domain
					well enough for which it is purposed. <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain
						Driven Design (DDD)</a> tackles this problem by providing best
					practices for understanding the domain and utilizing that knowledge
					throughout the whole development process. It gives guidelines about
					how to make communication easier by defining an <a target="_blank"
						href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">ubiquitious
						language</a>. This ubiquitous language is used by all team members,
					including domain experts and engineers, to prevent miscommunication
					that originates from different vocabulary being used. Engineers
					represent the domain knowledge in a <a target="_blank"
						href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html">domain
						model</a>. This can be done by creating documentation with the <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">Unified
						Modeling Language (UML)</a> using class diagrams, activity diagrams
					and such, then translating it to code following the DDD principles
					either manually or using <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture">Model
						Driven Architecture (MDA)</a> and <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_software_development">Model
						Driven Software Development (MDSD)</a>. Alternatively you can simply
					do this in your mind without any modeling or code generation tools,
					skipping the intermediate step and translating the model directly
					into code. In any case the idea here is to use the ubiquitous
					language and domain model consistently for communication,
					documentation and code.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					One of the problems of the <a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly">DDD
						introductory literature</a> is that it focuses a lot on the <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayered_architecture">business
						layer (which they call domain layer)</a> and thus more on the backend
						side of application development. No criticism here, since their
					patterns there are great and the idea of using a distinction
					between value objects, entities, repositories and services (among a
					few more) helps structuring that side of applications a lot. But
					DDD can be applied to the presentation layer as well with great
					benefits. When researching in that direction, one easily stumbles
					upon the next pattern this framework is based on, the ...

				<h3>1.2) Naked Objects Pattern</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					The <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">Naked
						Objects Pattern</a> is building on the premise, that a good domain
					model is suitable to be externalized as a user interface. And vice
					versa that the requirement of externalizing it, results in a better
					domain model. How this externalization of a domain model looks like
					in practice is demonstrated by the following example:
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 style="text-align: center">Domain Model Gets Converted to
					User Interface</h4>
				<img style="border: solid 1px; background: white"
					alt="Domain Model Gets Converted to
					User Interface"
					wicket:id="contractModel2UIImg" width="100%" />
				<hr>
				<p style="font-size: medium">Here you see that:
				<ul>
					<li>each class is represented individually as an area in the
						UI</li>
					<li>getters and setters result in input fields</li>
					<li>a list of contracts associated with the customer results
						in a table being displayed</li>
					<li>action methods result in buttons</li>
					<li>each element in the UI can be identified via a bean path
						in the model (e.g. 'name', 'contract.status' or 'address.street'
						relative to the customer class)</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					For this to work, you will notice that the domain model not only
					contains the state (properties), but also the logic about how to
					manipulate it (actions). The model thus becomes intelligent and the
					Naked Objects Pattern uses that intelligence to make it available
					as an user interface (UI). To understand this better, please see
					the next graphic for a comparison of applications based on the <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model
						View Controller (MVC) Pattern</a> and applications based on the Naked
					Objects Pattern:

					Layered Architecture</h4>

					alt="MVC vs Naked Objects in a Layered Architecture"
					wicket:id="nakedObjectsVsMvcImg" width="100%" /> <br>

				<hr>
				<p style="font-size: medium">With this it becomes apparent what
					the Naked Objects Pattern is aiming for. By being able to match the
					views to the models, you can completely remove the controller layer
					and automate it using binding conventions to the intelligent
					models. The application thus becomes simpler to understand and
					easier to maintain, since you are forced not to allow the clutter
					between the view and model to appear in the first place. In MVC,
					the controller layer is normally implemented to handle differences
					in the layers, but the Naked Objects Pattern makes this obsolete.</p>
				<h3>1.3) RAD & CRUD vs Naked Objects</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					The Naked Objects Pattern goes even further conceptually and says
					it can completely generate the view for you based on those binding
					conventions. In practice this idea is often manifested in <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development">Rapid
						Application Development (RAD)</a> and <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">Create
						Read Update Delete (CRUD)</a> frameworks. When they also promise to
					provide data driven user interfaces, you will mostly see fancy
					looking web pages with lots of tables that display database
					entities with common data manipulation facilities you are used from
					CRUD. Those frameworks sure are nice for CRUD applications, but
					fail miserably for more complex and customized user interfaces. As
					soon as you try to deviate from their chosen conventions and try to
					extend their views or even modify them, these frameworks will in
					the worst case make it so hard for you, that you are forced to
					writing your view from scratch in those special cases. RAD and
					rapid prototyping is nice and this framework is also usable in this
					direction, but a good framework should give you the freedom to
					extend and modify the generated views as easily as possible. The
					idea to provide this freedom in this framework is by embracing
					Wicket instead of hiding its existence, thus still making easily
					accessible everything you can do with Wicket. Since Wicket is a MVC
					framework, applying the Naked Objects Pattern on it is easy and has
					to just focus on automating parts of the Controller and View for
					you while still allowing you to use your own code as a replacement
					for the defaults where needed.
				</p>
				<h3>1.4) Document View Architecture</h3>
				<p style="font-size: medium">One more problem with many CRUD
					frameworks is that they usually bind to entities from the
					persistence layer and are thus interwoven with the data management.
					When you want to use entities for the UI you might have to extend
					them with UI specific annotations and methods for e.g.:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ordering of fields</li>
					<li>internationalizing strings</li>
					<li>providing choices for combo boxes</li>
					<li>retrieving data from tables or saving data to tables</li>
					<li>converting the data into a different form to be displayed</li>
					<li>opening modal dialogs or displaying status messages</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="font-size: medium">This for example has the following
					drawbacks:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>you cannot reuse your existing (maybe legacy) entities for
						new views, since they might not match in structure</li>
					<li>you might need to call repositories or services from your
						entity while your architecture suggests keeping them stupid, for
						data holding purposes only</li>
					<li>you might accidentally mix the DDD concepts of service,
						repository and entity and put everything in your entities</li>
					<li>you cannot reuse the entities easily in other modules
						since they are bound to your UI framework</li>
					<li>refactorings in your UI might lead to refactorings in your
						database and vice versa</li>
					<li>it is not easy to write reusable Wicket pages, panels and
						components when they are bound to a specific persistence layer
						framework</li>
					<li>some entity hierarchies might be so complex that they have
						to be split among multiple views/tabs/wizards, each having
						different requirements on the model and needs to hide things</li>
					<li>you may want different perspectives on the same data but
						the entity class does not match all perspectives properly</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="font-size: medium">
					Here the <a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/mfc/chp3/chapter3.htm">Document
						View Architecture</a> comes in handy. Instead of putting everything
					into your entities and using them as your models for the UI, you
					implement documents that match directly to the desired views you
					want. The documents handle data retrieval and manipulation using
					services and repositories and provide adjusted data from the
					entities where needed or just delegate to those directly where
					appropriate. The documents can even reuse entity classes completely
					where possible and extend them from the outside by providing
					additions and overrides for the nested properties and actions.
					Applying the Document View Architecture enables this framework to
					give you the freedom of choosing your own frameworks for the
					business and persistence layer. This makes it a lightweight web
					framework instead of a complete development platform.
