					<h2>3) Framework History</h2>
				</legend>
				<p style="font-size: medium">There exist two independent
					predecessors of this framework that were used as inspiration:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a target="_blank"
						href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gengui/">gengui</a>: This
						was the first implementation that was done with <a target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a>
						for the desktop and <a target="_blank"
						href="http://www.creamtec.com/products/ajaxswing/">AjaxSwing</a>
						as an addon for web transformation of the Swing code. It was the
						first one to define the idea of a naked objects framework like
						this. The core concepts about how the framework should behave and
						how the intelligent models should be coded originates from there.</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Nocket/nocket">nocket</a>
						(previously codenamed DMDWebGen): This implementation was based on
						Wicket and was using <a target="_blank"
						href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">twitter-bootstrap 2.x.x</a>
						and custom developed components. It was reusing the concepts of
						gengui, as well as code of its reflection API and applied it to a
						more web like development paradigm.</li>
				</ul>

				<hr>

				<p style="font-size: medium">The following differences exist
					between this framework and the other two:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This framework shares no code with those and is a <b>complete
							rewrite</b>. It shares only the core ideas and diverges in
						implementation details.
					</li>
					<li>The parts where <b>intelligent models</b> (domain objects
						called there) diverge most are in the use of different annotations
						and the handling of tabbed panels. Also the @BeanPathRedirect used
						here can rewrite complete bean paths (by changing the type of a
						property) instead of just being able to decorate bean path end
						points (which you can still do to add utility methods) as the
						gengui @Decorate annotation does. The solution here is thus more
						versatile.
					</li>
					<li>Complex <b>custom validators</b> that validate against
						other model fields have become more intelligent and do not require
						a @Eager workaround for the order of synchronization. Instead the
						validators get called once more after valid properties have been
						synchronized from the browser to the model to allow complex
						validators to produce a correct result the second time.
					</li>
					<li>The new implementation tries to fix a few bad <b>design
							decisions</b> and code smells of the previous implementation.
						Especially inside the GuiService by dividing the concerns of
						GuiTasks instead of implementing everything in one complicated
						class that is hard to debug. Also the reflection API was tried to
						be improved by introducing invesdwin-norva as an independent
						framework.
					</li>
					<li>The <b>reflection</b> part is based on invesdwin-norva
						which allows the bean path constants class generator to work as an
						annotation processor. This fixes a nasty productivity problem with
						refactorings of models: Previously the compiler and generator
						would lock out the developer when the <b>constants generator</b>
						failed, because the model cannot be compiled, because a bean path
						constant from the constants class is referenced for which the
						model element was renamed. It was quite tricky previously to work
						around cases like these during refactorings. With the new solution
						of switching to java source based processing using <b>javax.lang.model</b>
						instead of java reflection on bytecode, the generator still runs
						on model classes that do not compile completely, so the constants
						are already there when the model needs to be actually compiled or
						manually fixed.
					</li>
					<li>Instead of building most <b>components</b> from scratch,
						this framework reuses open source solutions like wicket-bootstrap.
						This results in higher quality and extensible components, better
						bootstrap integration and better maintainability. Also the
						paradigm how tables are bound is different here. Instead of using
						table templates in the HTML, a more generic table tag is used with
						the possibility to customize the table using a BindingInterceptor.
						This removes refactoring intensive code from the HTML file and
						reduces the overall code required to implement the table
						component. Filtering and ordering table columns is still possible
						using @Hide or the hideXyz utility method and via @ColumnOrder or
						the columnOrder utility method.
					</li>
					<li><b>Modal dialogs</b> have been simplified by reusing the <a
						target="_blank" href="http://jschr.github.io/bootstrap-modal/">bootstrap-modal</a>
						library and building on intelligent model based dialogs. The
						decision was made to stay away from a callbacks based alternative
						since it resulted in a switch of paradigm that is unnecessary.</li>
					<li>Instead of implementing a custom <b>security</b> layer,
						spring-security and apache shiro were integrated as more versatile
						providers in this regard.
					</li>
					<li>Paradigms that originated from desktop development were
						ignored to favor ones that feel more aligned with Wicket and <b>web
							development</b>.
					</li>
					<li>This implementation aims to be <b>developer friendly</b>
						by providing helpful error messages and warnings about common
						development problems where possible. Also this project aims to be
						easily accessible by providing a comprehensive documentation.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="font-size: medium">This framework would not exist
					without the work on the other ones and the people behind them. The
					other frameworks still have valid use cases today and a plethora of
					applications built with them. The reference on them here is made to
					praise them and to highlight the differences between these
					frameworks. This framework owes them a lot and is thankful that
					they got open sourced as well.</p>
