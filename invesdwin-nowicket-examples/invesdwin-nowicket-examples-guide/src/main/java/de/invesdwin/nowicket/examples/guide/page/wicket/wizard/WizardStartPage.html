			This is a rewrite of the <a target="_blank"
				href="http://examples7x.wicket.apache.org/wizard/">"wizard for
				creating a new user" example from Wicket</a>. Here we do not use the
			wizard extension from Wicket, but instead implement our own wizard to
			demonstrate more of the framework. Click one of the buttons below to
			walk through the wizard either in page form or in modal form. Both
			variations share the same code (which demonstrates the degree of
			reuse possible with invesdwin-NoWicket). If you want to compare the
			lines of code, this example has 613 lines of java code, while Wicket
			ones has 304 (for the create user sample) plus additionally 1093
			lines of java code for the wizard extension, thus 1397 lines of java
			code (measured with <a target="_blank"
				href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sloccount/">sloccount</a> at
			the time of writing this example). Not counting the HTML, which is
			mostly generated here. Also keep in mind that the wizard
			implementation here was not designed for general reusability. Instead
			it is supposed to be an example of how one can go about implementing
			this when wanting to keep all flexibilities.
